Management is for actually working with the files.

Stable is where the latest working iterations of ANUBIS reside (everything in there now is garbage thanks to the latest updates that are being designed).

Dev is where the work is being done.  Note, the receptor.anubis file is actually a perl script and the latest features (involving mod.xml and config.xml) where servers are stored and modified ARE NOT COMPLETE!!!  I am currently working on a way to make sure that the receptor.anubis program does not leave the end-user susceptible to viruses by people who add and remove servers who don't have the authority to do so.
